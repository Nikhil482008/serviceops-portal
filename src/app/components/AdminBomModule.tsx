 * decides how long their versions survive, and Policies holds the reusable targeting all
 * three share.
 *
 * This module used to be a React re-implementation of the BOM prototype, which meant the
 * same screens existed twice — once here and once in the prototype — and the two drifted
 * apart with every change. The prototype IS the module now: it lives at
 * `public/bom-admin/index.html` and is mounted here directly, so admin BOM and technician
 * BOM are maintained in one place.
 *
 * It is a self-contained document (no build step, no imports), and it already understands
 * `?embed=1` — that suppresses its own topbar because this shell already draws one. */
